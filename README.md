# Honeybird

Honeybird is a simple yet functional app intended to create a memorable experience with the combination of food and delivery. It creates a bond between the restaurant, the deliverer, and the consumer. The name Honeybird is inspired by the quick nature and the diet of the beautiful hummingbird. Two birds seen facing away from each other can be seen in our logo. More on the brand can be read here: https://honeybird.netlify.app/pattern-library/#brand
